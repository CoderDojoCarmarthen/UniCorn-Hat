There are two files for this program .
moon.py 
This is the main program and runs a script that works out the phase of the moon and returns a value. 
There is an if statement that then runs a function within the moonphase.py script.

moonphase.py
The moon is set to display for 5 sec when moon.py is run.
At the bottom the 8 phases are commented out , but if you un-comment them you can run moonphase.py as a stand alone script .
